This project implements a machine learning model to classify text data as hate speech, offensive speech, or neutral. It preprocesses the text data, tokenizes the inputs, converts them into numerical representations, and trains a model to categorize the input comments accordingly. The project is built using Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn.
